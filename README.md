# Medkit_AI2 And OD Effect For Dayz
Adding a Medkit AI-2 being able to heal the Player.
Also adding a new "Drug" Vital constant.

Now Painkillers, Morphine, Antibiotics (and ofc, AI-2) can lead the player to an Overdose (Blurry vision, Vomit, Fall unconscious... and die).
The amount of indesirable effect is scalled on the abuse.
